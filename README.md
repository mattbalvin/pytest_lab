# pytest_lab - Experiments with Pytest

This project serves as a template project to support well tested cloud development and CI/CD workflows with Python and Pytest. The project is used as a testbed for learning about and experimenting with using pytest features to deploy within actual projects so much of the code being tested will be excerpted/simplified from other projects to focus on the mechanics of the testing.

## Building pytest_lab

```sh
make install
```

## CI/CD Automation

CI/CD automation is using github actions.
